## üìù Change Log

#### v2025.2
* New action to convert images to webp!
    * Dependency `cwebp` - installed via `brew install webp`  
    * If `cwebp` is not installed - action will tell you to install it
* New action to shrink videos!
    * Dependency `ffmpeg` - installed via `brew install ffmpeg`  
    * If `ffmpeg` is not installed - action will tell you to install it

#### v2025.1
* Refreshed icons!
* Removed the copy file name to clipboard when renaming a file, as it was unnecessary and made pasting a new name impossible
* Fixed the Copy & Paste File action to now reliably paste the file - you can copy and paste any file type (e.g., pdfs, txt, zip, etc) üòé
* Updated create file action to use the new TextView instead of just touching the file - now you can give the text file content or not 
* Update create folder action to not navigate you back to the newly created folder but the parent folder - so you can easily do actions on the created folder (like make a new file, etc)

---

#### v2024.3
* Added support to rename files
* Added the word "touch" to the create new file action
